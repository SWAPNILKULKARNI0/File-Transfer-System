File Transfer System
Description:
The File Transfer System is a robust application designed to enable secure and efficient file sharing between users. The system supports user authentication, file upload/download functionalities, and ensures data integrity during transfers. With an intuitive interface, the system simplifies file management tasks while maintaining security and performance.

Features:

Secure File Uploads and Downloads: Supports safe transfer of files between authenticated users.
User Authentication: Ensures only authorized users can access the system, with secure login and registration mechanisms.
File Management: Users can view uploaded files and manage their transfer history.
Scalable Design: Supports multiple users concurrently without compromising performance.
Error Handling: Robust mechanisms to handle upload/download failures and ensure user feedback.
Technologies Used:

Frontend: React.js, HTML, CSS for a responsive and user-friendly interface.
Backend: Node.js, Express.js for managing API endpoints and file transfer logic.
Database: MongoDB for storing user credentials and file metadata.
Additional Tools: JWT for secure user authentication, Multer for handling file uploads, and RESTful APIs for smooth client-server communication.
Challenges Overcome:

Implementing a secure file upload mechanism while maintaining performance.
Integrating JWT-based authentication with file handling workflows.
Ensuring the system scales efficiently to handle multiple users simultaneously.
